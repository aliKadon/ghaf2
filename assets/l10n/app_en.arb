You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.\nIf you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.\nPlease note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.\nTo exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by email: info@ghafgate.com.\nYour data protection rights, described above, are covered by the CCPA, short for the California Consumer Privacy Act.
