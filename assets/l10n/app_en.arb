However, Ghaf Gate may also withdraw loyalty bonuses at any point and without warning or liability.\n●\tAny attempt to manipulate the system and use of coupons or codes by participation via any party, camouflaging identity by manipulating IP addresses, using identities other than their own or any other automated means (including systems which can be programmed to do so), will render the associated orders and use of Ghaf Points invalid and may potentially lead to that account being deactivated or the parties responsible prosecuted within the framework of the applicable law.\n \n8.3 GHAF FRIEND (REFERRAL PROGRAM)\nGhaf Friend is a referral program through which users can invite family & friends to use Ghaf Gate and receive Ghaf Points as a reward in the application once the invited users place their first order.\n●\tReferrer is a user who invites someone to place an order through Ghaf Gate, . The referrer will receive a reward in the form of Ghaf Points once the person invited successfully completes his/her first order; the offer is valid for new users on their first order only.\n●\tIn case of an order placed and cancelled by the user invited the referrer will not be eligible for the reward.\n●\tGhaf Gate reserves all rights to change the amounts communicated under the Ghaf Friend program at any point in time.\n8.4. PARTNERS (SHOPS) LOYALTY CARD\nWhen making your purchases from shops that apply a customer reward system, through the App, you have the opportunity to enter your membership card number in the corresponding field when completing the order so as to ensure that the points corresponding to the purchases you made are credited to the account you have in the respective shop.\n \n            * CUSTOMER SERVICE & COMPLAINTS\n \nGhaf Gate Customer Service provides information regarding any questions, issues or complaints related to the Ghaf Gate service. Users may contact Ghaf Gate via e-mail (info@Ghafgate.com) , drop a message through the app. Missing items must be reported immediately on reception of the Groceries, otherwise Groceries are considered to have been accepted by User as being in perfect condition. Latent defects must be reported to Ghaf Gate customer Service immediately after they come to light, although in these cases there are limitations of error acknowledgement.\n \n            * TIPPING\n \nTipping is a way Ghaf Gate users can reward the drivers and pickers (staff) that are involved in executing their orders via the Ghaf Gate mobile applications or websites. Users tip the staff directly via the credit/debit card they have registered. Any tip paid by the customer via the Ghaf Gate mobile applications or websites will be non-refundable. All tips paid by the customer will be paid in the local currency of the country from where the orders are placed.\nUpon rating an order with Ghaf Gate, the customer will have the option to make a discretionary payment of a tip to Ghaf Gate in addition to the purchase price of the items in the order. Ghaf Gate will subtract any transactional fees related to the online payment gateway and bank transfer cost and shall transfer the remaining amount to staff involved in the execution of each specific order at a monthly or bimonthly basis. Therefore Any charges levied by the bank or payment gateway will be covered by the staff.

Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)\nCalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.\nAccording to CalOPPA we agree to the following:\n0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;\n0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;\n0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;\n0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at info@ghafgate.com.\nOur Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:\nWe honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place.

Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)\nIf you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:\n0.1. What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to you:\n0.0.1. The categories of personal information we have collected about you.\n0.0.2. The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information.\n0.0.3.

When you make this request, the information provided may be limited to the personal information we collected about you in the previous 12 months.\n0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same.

We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.\nIf you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.\nPlease note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.\nTo exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by email: info@ghafgate.com.\nYour data protection rights, described above, are covered by the CCPA, short for the California Consumer Privacy Act. To find out more, visit the official California Legislative Information website. The CCPA took effect on 01/01/2020.\n13. Service Providers\nWe may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (“Service Providers”), provide Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services or assist us in analysing how our Service is used.\nThese third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.\n14.

In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).\nWe will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.\n19. Links to Other Sites\nOur Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.\nWe have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.\nFor example, the outlined privacy policy has been made using PolicyMaker.io, a free tool that helps create high-quality legal documents. PolicyMaker’s privacy policy generator is an easy-to-use tool for creating a privacy policy for blog, website, e-commerce store or mobile app.\n20. Children’s Privacy\nOur Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 18 (“Child” or “Children”).\nWe do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from Children under 18.
